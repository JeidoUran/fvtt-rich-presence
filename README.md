A Foundry VTT module that enables Discord Rich Presence on a Foundry world. It sends some information about the user such as class, level, or whether they're currently in a battle or not.

**Note: In order to use this module, you also need to be using my fork of [FVTT Desktop Client](https://github.com/JeidoUran/fvtt-player-client), as it contains the necessary code to send the data exposed by this module to Discord.**

The module has been tested on D&D5e and PF2e. I do not know how well or if it would work at all on other game systems.

- **Every player logging in to this World needs to follow these steps. Rich Presence is turned off on both the Client and Module by default.**

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [cswendrowski](https://github.com/cswendrowski), as this module is a spiritual successor to [FoundryVTT Discord Rich Presence](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-Discord-Rich-Presence?tab=readme-ov-file). While the execution and final results are vastly different, the original idea comes from seeing their module.
